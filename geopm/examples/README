We need add some examples, but where to start?  There are so many options
currently available without even going into what the example would compute.

OPTIONS
=======

Policy
------
- Configuration file
  * RM linked
  * RM calls executable
  * Without geopm runtime
  * With geopm runtime
- Shared memory RM interface
  * With geopm runtime

Control Execution
-----------------
- geopmctl
- geopm_ctl_spawn()
- geopm_ctl_pthread()

Control Granularity
-------------------
- Compute node
- MPI process
- Per CPU control (using pinned OpenMP threading model for sampling)

Sample Execution
----------------
- geopm_prof* calls
- MPI_Pcontrol regions + MPI profiling (modified IPM or mpiP)
- Sample MSRs from decoupled external process

Sample Granularity
------------------
- Compute node
- MPI process
- Per CPU sampling (using pinned OpenMP threading model)

Decision Execution
------------------
- Limiter
- Balancer
- Temporal shifting
- Others?

Communication Algorithm
-----------------------
- Ring around the network MPI_Isend()
- Ring around the network MPI_Send()
- MPI_Reduce()
- MPI_All_reduce()
- MPI_All_to_all()

Compute Algorithm
-----------------
- STREAM
- FFT
- DGEMM
- sort

Simple Stream
=============
- Control Execution: geopm_ctl_step()
- Control Granularity: Compute node
- Sample Execution: geopm_prof* calls
- Sample Granularity: MPI process
- Decision Execution: Limiter
- Communication Algorithm: Ring around the network MPI_Send()
- Compute Algorithm: STREAM
