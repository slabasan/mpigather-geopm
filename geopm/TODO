BUGS
----

geopmpolicy-whitelist-root
    - "geopmpolicy -w" requires root access, but output is only a
      function of cpuid (2015-10-12).

geopmpolicy-extra-obj
    - There are many objects compiled into libgeopmpolicy which are
      not needed (2015-10-30).

out-of-place-testing
    - Building out of place works correctly, but testing out of place
      does not, gtest links are broken and the license header check
      does not work (2015-10-30).

policy-hint-ignored
    - Policy hint is being entirely ignored.  Should be stored in the
      state of the region and inform the decider (2016-05-06).

no-app-runtime
    - The SampleRegulator attempts to interpolate runtime from the
      data returned by the application.  The application does not
      provide runtime information, and the runtime is only needed
      after the region has completed (2016-05-06).

runtime-decider-change
    - The Policy object enables the deciders to be chaged during
      runtime, but the Controller does not switch the deciders during
      runtime if the Policy changes.  The code should at least throw
      an error if the Policy's decider is changed during runtime
      (2016-06-17).

ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------

extend-unit-tests
    - Test coverage is too low.  Need to expand unit testing to
      increase coverage. (2015-12-14)

improve-documentation
    - Add detail to doxygen comments where @brief descriptions are all
      that is provided.  Unify documentation style. (2015-12-14)

fix-klocwork-issues
    - Fix all critical and error level issues exposed by static source
      code analysis with klocwork (2016-11-03).

HIGH PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------

resource-manager-integration
    - Look into integration with SLURM, PBS-pro, Torque and COBALT
      (2016-05-06).

cpu-frequency-platform
    - To enable deciders that use CPU frequency for control need to
      implement a Platform plugin with right granularity of
      measurement and control (2015-2-1).

enable-telemetry-extension
    - Currently collecting a limited set of hardware telemetry.  Some
      decision algorithms will want to sample other signals, and we
      need to make signal inclusion more easily extensible
      (2016-05-06).

enhance-profiling-support
    - Enable more hardware telemetry to be recorded to the trace and
      final report produced by the geopm profiler (2016-05-20).

change-scheduler-scope
    - Change the use of the SampleScheduler to account for the overhead
      introduced by ProfileThread interface (tprof), not just the
      overhead from the Profile interface (2016-05-06).

profile-wo-runtime
    - Add feature to geopmpolicy so that it can create a report when
      run before and after an application completes.  This can be
      implemented by differencing performance counter values read at
      application completion and comparison with values stored to disk
      prior to application start up.

enable-geopm-profiling
    - Enable performance profiling of the geopm code itself.
      Determine the overhead the run-time requires and enable
      reporting at different levels of granularity. (2015-12-14)

investigate-powerapi-integration
    - Look into how geopm might integrate with Sandia's
      PowerAPI. (2015-12-14)

collect-bmc-data
    - Collect out of band data at a low sample rate and interpolate
      results. Find a way to get access to this data on the compute
      cores, especially when CPU doesn't have access to out of band
      network supporting BMC data. (2015-12-14)

enable-cpu-granularity
    - Investigate enabling the decider to set policies per-CPU and the
      platform to give the decider data at per-CPU resolution.  The
      platform would provide an abstraction that maps the hardware
      domains of control and observation granularity to appear to be
      per-CPU (2016-05-06).

enable-rm-signal-abnormal
    - In an emergency power situation where the resource manager has
      interfered with power limits by a mechanism other than geopm,
      enable the resource manager to signal this to the geopm runtime.
      This signal can be used to ignore measurements made while other
      power management systems are interfering. (2016-05-13)

application-data-aliasing
    - If the application is calling into the profile APIs at a rate
      faster than the controller is sampling counters, the
      interpolation done by the controller can dilute the application
      data fidelity through aliasing (2016-10-31).

per-region-mpi-accounting
    - Report out MPI time for each region, total application MPI time,
      and total application MPI time outside of user defined regions
      (2016-10-31).

ompt-callback-region
    - Use the OpenMP "omp_t" callbacks to mark regions in the
      application (2016-07-15).

check-linux-cpu-governor
    - Make sure that no Linux CPU governor is running that will
      conflict with GEO (2016-05-19).

LOW PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------------

generate-aggregated-report
    - Currently one report file per compute node, aggregate data based
      on depth parameter passed to the Profile::print()
      method. (2015-12-14)

gui-report-explorer
    - Write a post-processing application to enable exploration of
      generated report data. This is a nice to have feature, and may
      be especially useful for debug purposes, but is a low priority.
      (2015-12-14)

enable-automatic-profiling
    - Provide interface for algorithms attempting to do automatic
      detection of application regions and progress through analysis
      of hardware events. This is a stretch goal: although the data
      required will be collected, designing the interface to provide
      it to an outside agent may break designs for
      encapsulation. (2015-12-14)

dox-fortran-c-confusion
    - The doxygen generated developer documentation web pages are
      confusing the fortran and C interface documentation:
      http://geopm.github.io/geopm/dox/annotated.html
      http://geopm.github.io/geopm/dox/interfacegeopm_1_1geopm__prof__create.html
      (2016-05-30)
